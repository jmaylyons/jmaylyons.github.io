<p class="pos_fixed">Words. 
<br>
In a nutshell, words.
<br>
My love of them brought me to the field of journalism.
Although merely a combination of sounds, words lie at the helm of human expression. There is nothing like finding just the right word to describe something. Ask me for a masterpiece, and I’ll hand you a dictionary. <br>
 
In fact, that is where it began. In my early years, I would flip through the pages of a scholastic dictionary for fun—before the days of Google. I always wanted to know more, learn more and see more. This past summer, my wanderlust led me to Malakoff, France, where I studied French culture while staying with a host family. 

In hindsight I realize the word for these feelings: curiosity. <br>

I decided I wanted to combine my love of words with my curiosity, which is why I am pursuing journalism. 

Inspiration came my first year at the University of Florida when I took Introduction to Journalism. Up until that point, I had never thought of journalism as storytelling. 

The assigned reading, Rick Bragg’s “Somebody Told Me,” opened my eyes to the incredible stories that await any journalist willing to go out and find them. 

I marveled at the story of a homeless man who preferred jail to his living on the streets, survivors who struggle to put their lives together after the Oklahoma City bombing and inmates who were so old they forgot the crime that put them behind bars.

I realized journalists could move an audience to tears with the mere power of words. The words journalists write make a difference, and contributing to society is something I insist on doing with the path I take in life. 

I didn’t just choose journalism for myself. As silly as it may sound, I feel a strong urge to give “Nowhere Man” the news. In the old Beatles song of that title, Nowhere Man “Doesn't have a point of view. Knows not where he's going to. Isn't he a bit like you and me?”

He deserves the chance to be informed. Ignorance is not bliss, nor is knowledge a curse. 

The mantra to “seek truth and report it” fills me with a sense of purpose. I can’t help but hope that for all the lies out there, bringing the public as much truth as possible might help a little.
<br>
In fact, it might help a lot.

<p>After Rosa Parks sat, Rosa Williams walked. It was the late 1950s, back when blacks and whites in Gainesville had different water fountains, different restaurants, different schools. African Americans went to the Negro library on Northwest First Street, where the shelves were stocked with books with missing pages and coloring in the margins.&#160;</p>
