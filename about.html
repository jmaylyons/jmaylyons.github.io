 I was born in Orlando, Fla., but grew up 20 minutes north in Apopka, a town most natable for its
World Series finalist Little League team, indoor foliage festival and overly polluted lake.
I don't Bible thump, but my beliefs can be summed up by Romans 8:38-39.
My mom was a country girl, born and raised
in St. Thomas, Jamaica. My father was a city boy who grew up in Fort Wayne, 
Indiana.
They met as students at Tuskegee Institute, and now years later, my sisters and I term ourselves "Jamerican."

As for Journalism, I ended up here through a series of fortunate events. 
It started my sophomore year in high school when my sister recommended I write for the student newspaper. 
Two years later, I was accepted to the Univerity of Florida and decided to major in journalism. 
I grew up viewing journalism as more impersonal, cold.

But I was wrong.

I thank the art of storytelling for that. My freshman year at UF I was introduded to true storytelling. 
I devoured page after page of Rick Bragg's "Somebody Told Me,"
and I realized I knew what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.

Now, in my junior year at the j-school I've been able to immerse myself in the field. I spend two nights a week working
from 6 to past midnight at the Independent Florida Alligator copy desk,
I spend two days a week at the Gainesville Sun, where I shadow city reporter Chris Curry, and I spend at least two 
hours a week thinking about ice cream.
