Have you ever wondered...
<br>
What does a French/African taxi driver think of Justin Timberlake? Do Italians actually say Mamma Mia?
Is cheese covered in mold appetizing? How many movie/tv references can one girl make in a series of posts?
<br>
If you answered yes to at least one of those questions, have I got the blog for you.
This past summer, my wanderlust brought me
To Europe, where I spent a month living with a host family in Malakoff, France. That's me at Jardin des Tuileries, in case you're curious. Taking two metro lines
every morning to reach my classes in Paris started out as an adventure and now is just a fond memory of a place
where decent public transportation was actually a thing. 
I have been studying la lange d'amour since high school and
jumped at the chance to study in France.
In fact, my travels influenced my decision to double major in French and Francophone studies at UF, and I am also pursuing an international relations certificate. The goal is to be fluent.
I have been documenting my experience in France with my blog. It's ongoing, so feel free to start reading! You can find
the link below!
