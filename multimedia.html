<h1>Interview with Laura Sjoberg</h1>
<article>
Below is a snippet of questions I asked <a href="http://polisci.ufl.edu/laura-sjoberg/">Laura Sjoberg</a>, Ph.d, associate professor of political science at UF and a feminist
scholar of international politics. Her past work has been published in International Studies Quarterly, International Studies Review, International Studies Perspectives, International Politics,
International Relations, Politics and Gender, and International Political Sociology.
  
  <br>
  
  <br>
  1.<em>What first sparked your interest in international relations (how 
did you get into the field)?</em>
<br>

I was a policy debater in high school and college. That is a research activity, where most of the research is in IR, political science, and philosophy- trying to make that work policy-relevant. I got hooked then, and am still at it.

<br>
<br>
2.<em>How helpful is knowledge of another language in international 
relations?</em>

<br>
Vary helpful. If I could go back and change anything about my training, it would be to choose languages strategically, and apply myself in studying them.
<br>
<br>
3.<em>What realm of international security do you believe is the most 
underdeveloped in academia?</em>
<br>

Thinking about the intersection of international political economy and international security, probably. This is an area where feminist work has been pioneering.
<br>
<br>
4.<em>Would you recommend studying abroad for students interested in 
international relations? Why?</em>
<br>
I would recommend study abroad to anyone. It is a great experience that broadens your view of the world.
<br>
<br>
5.<em>Can you tell me a little bit about your current research?</em>
<br>
I am just finishing a book on women who commit genocidal rape. The next two projects are underway: one using queer theory to critique IR's recent reliance on evolutionary biology; the other a study of male members of the US military who sell sex for money.
