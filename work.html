<p> 
I'll never forget my first story for The Independent Florida Alligator. It had to do with a special program
    the astronomy department was hosting for high school students. <br>
    It was horrible. 
    <br>
    I was told it was published online,
    but I think they were just being nice. I'll also never forget the last story I wrote for the Alligator before I was
    hired as a copy editor. I was looking for any event to cover for Reporting two summers ago,
    and I stumbled upon a coupon clipping class. Little did I know, it would make quite the story. I sent it to the
    Alligator, and while I was there editing, one of the editors remembered my name from the copy editing test.
    She asked me if I would be interested in working there.
    <br>
    I said yes.
    <br>
    Since then, I've come a long way, and I have gotten to cover topics ranging from
    something as serious as the utility issues in Gainesville to more lighthearted topics—like a security guard at a 
    retirement home who takes residents' coupons from the trash.
