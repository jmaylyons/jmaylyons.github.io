WARNING: Have Google translate ready. 

It's not surprise that I love French culture, and as a French major and as a student pursuing an international relations
certificate, I would like to hone my skills with a foreign tongue, so the following research will be presented in French.
My research will look closely at the concept of "security" discussed in international relations.
In international relations studies, security does not necessarily fall under miliary security.
Many different types of security exist, including human, environmental, and health security. With my research,
I have uncovered two topics of differing aspects of security. The first covers the problem of <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/video/ap-exclusive-inside-chicagos-gang-violence/1684814925001">gang
violence in Chicago/a>, a more traditional realist view of security in a physical sense. The second analyzes a French
poem <em> Vous ne saurez jamais... </em>, which delves into the more subjective arena of human emotional security.
