This website would not be complete without addressing my adventures abroad. This past summer, my wander lust brought me
To Europe, where I spent a month living with a host family in Malakoff France. I would take two metro lines
every morning to reach my classes in Paris. I have been studying la lange d'amour since high school and a chance
to jump right into the language was exactly what I needed.
This summer, I learned many things about myself, but also many things about life, that, to put
quite simply, all of the internships in the U.S. combined could not teach me.
Going abroad exposes you to a completely different culture and outlook on life.

In my time abroad, I only visited France and Italy, but the plan is to go back and go back soon. I'd even
like to retun to France with a program to teach English for a school year. 
I am currently a French minor at UF, and I am pursuing an international relations certificate. The goal is to be fluent.

I have been documenting my experience in France with my blog. It's ongoing, so feel free to start reading!
